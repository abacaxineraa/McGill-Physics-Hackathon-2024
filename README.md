# Relatively Monstrous

Our game combines special relativity with fun gameplay, allowing players to experience time dilation and length contraction as they control a slime blob. By speeding up and shooting photons to see the past, players interact with physics concepts in an intuitive and engaging way. Our vision is to make learning relativity accessible and enjoyable through interactive gameplay!
